                    <p>Further in my freer time, I write blogs (<a href="https://guru275.wordpress.com/"> guru275.wordpress.com </a>) where I review movies, analyze what the movie really meant, do some character retrospection and an in depth analysis of the "what's", "how's" and "where's" and most importantly, the "why's" of a movie. Sometimes, I also code, learn and keep pushing myself to try something new (Did I tell you guys about the time I set out to write 30 stories in 30 days?). These days I try to read books too, resolve my taxes and go cycling. I organise fun games for my team at office too!</p>

                    <p>Movies and the amazing treasure of Bollywood facts. Did you know that “Pretty Woman”, “Maine Pyaar Kiya” and “Dildaara” have tunes based on famous old Hollywood songs? More like this, when I am on board.</p>

                    <p>With an experience of handling college clubs, communities for events, happenings, marketing and social media strategies combined with my love for Bollywood, media and entertainment, I can enrich your content on Instagram.
                    <br><br><br>
                    I can remember facts and lesser-known happenings from the media industry even in my sleep. Happy birthday tributes, landmarks, upcoming celebrations of SRK movies and more - I got it all.
                    <br><br><br>
                    After I start, I want to spend some time understanding the content your page is aiming for and eventually start talking about the lesser known Hollywood's connection with Bollywood music, SRKs connection to Mangalore and about how Tom Cruise and Saif Ali Khan were once considered for the same role by YRF.
